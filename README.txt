Basic setup is already avaible on heroku.
  Heroku:
	A sample database is already created for heroku.
	Two Users are already available
		Email : apuffy87@gmail.com
		Pass  : booger
		Email : jdoe@cs.utsa.edu
		Pass  : john1
	I created sample contacts for each to show off the search functionality, that allows only the contacts of the logged in user to display. Along with that, i also created sample messages/email for you too see each time you log in with the sample users above.

	Sign-up and Sign-in is straight forward.

	To create a contact once signed-in, by clicking add contact link will allow you to create the new contact, once created, you will be redirect to the search page, displaying all the contacts you created for that user. That page will also allow to show, edit, and delete the contact.

	To view and create an message/email you'll click the message link, then that will display all the message/email you have received. Create a message/email by clicking the new link, which will direct you to the new message/email page. There you can use the drop down box to choose a contact email youd like to message/email. Once the email is created and sent you'll need to create a user with the same email as the contact email you sent to, so you can sign-in as that user and view the message.
